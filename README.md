       path: ~/

   ./target/release/dotherder --config dotfiles_config.yaml
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to select your dotfiles and create your new repo.

4. Enjoy your newly organized dotfiles!

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have ideas for improvements or new features. Let's make dotfile management a breeze together!

It would be great if config.yaml needed very little editing and covered most common .dotfiles, so please feel free to open a PR and add any you yourself find helpful!

## Config Structure

The `dotfiles` section contains a list of dotfile entries:

- `name`: Path to the dotfile, using `${HOME}` as a placeholder for the user's home directory. Home is replaced by the `--home` argument, defaulting to `~`

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have ideas for improvements or new features. Let's make dotfile management a breeze together!

It would be great if config.yaml needed very little editing and covered most common .dotfiles, so please feel free to open a PR and add any you yourself find helpful!
